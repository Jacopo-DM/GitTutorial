# Project Ideas

This section has three purposes:

1. Practice using the Git commands we learned in the [previous section](../get_started/index.md).

2. Give you realistic examples of how we could use Git to track a (coding) project.

3. Teach you how to `clone` and utilize open-source projects.

## Git Clone

The `git clone` command is used to copy a repository from a remote location to your local machine. <br>
This could be your own work you want to work on from a different computer, or it could be a project you want to contribute to, or it could be a project you want to use as a starting point for your own project.

The basic syntax for the `git clone` command is:

```bash
git clone <remote_location> <local_location>
```

The `remote_location` is the location of the repository you want to copy. This would be a URL to a GitHub repository.
The `local_location` is the location on your local machine where you want to copy the repository. This would be a path to a folder on your computer.

Don't worry if this doesn't make sense right now. We will be using the `git clone` command in the next section to clone a project.
