# About The Presenter


My name is *Jacopo Di Matteo*, I am an Italian final-year student of the [Master of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en).

I am currently working on my Master's thesis at the [Computational Intelligence group](https://cs.vu.nl/ci/) of the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/nl) in the field of [evolutionary robotics](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2015.00004/full).

I did my bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) between 2016 and 2020, where I also worked for two years as a software engineer at a startup company between 2018 to 2020.

Before that, in early 2016, I also participated in the [Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org/), where [I learned how to use 3D printers and CNC machines](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/waag/students/jacopo-dimatteo/assignments/week01/), as well as my [first experience using Git](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/waag/students/jacopo-dimatteo/assignments/week02/).
