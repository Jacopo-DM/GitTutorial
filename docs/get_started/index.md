# Prerequisites

To follow along with this workshop you will need to have certain software packages installed on your computer.
On this page, you can find which software packages you need to install, external links to the official websites of the software packages and instructions on how to install them.

## OS Specific Instructions

This guide makes use of "admonitions" to provide additional information for specific operating systems. 

Give the following example admonition a try to see how it works: 

!!! Failure ""
    === ":simple-windows:"

        This is a note for Windows users.

    === ":simple-apple:"

        This is a note for Mac users.
    
    === ":simple-linux:"

        This is a note for Linux users.


**Before you begin, you should make sure that you have access to all the following software packages:**

## A Web Browser

A web browser (e.g. [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?exp=e511&form=MA13FJ)) is necessary to follow along with this tutorial, as well as access Github.

## A Command Line Interface

To complete this tutorial, you will need access to a terminal window, any application that allows you to type commands and see the results of those commands. These kinds of applications already come pre-installed on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

### How To Check If You Have A Command Line Interface

!!! Failure ""
    === ":simple-windows:"

        The Windows console is called the **Command Prompt**, also named **cmd**.

        [Open Command Prompt on Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089) by selecting the Start button, typing `cmd` in the search box, and selecting the "Command Prompt" application.

## Text Editor

A text editor is a program that you can use to create and edit text files. It is a very important tool for developers because it allows you to write code and view the results of your work.

There are many different text editors available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Some of the most popular ones include:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
  
To install a text editor, follow the instructions on the official website of the text editor that you want to use.

**Visual Studio Code** is a good choice for beginners.

## Python 3

**Python 3.6 or later** is required to follow along with this tutorial, the latest official installation can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Two useful resources for installing Python 3 on Windows, Mac, and Linux are:

* [Python for Beginners: Getting Started](https://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/getting_started.html#what-is-python-exactly).
* [Python 3 Installation & Setup Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)

### Checking Your Python Version

If you're not sure which version of python you have installed, you can check by running one of the following in your terminal:

!!! Failure ""
    === ":simple-windows:"

        ```powershell
        py --version
        ```

    === ":simple-apple:"

        ```bash
        python3 --version
        ```

    === ":simple-linux:"

        ```bash
        python3 --version
        ```

This should return something like this:

!!! warning ""

    ```
    Python 3.10.10
    ```

## Pip

**Pip** is a package manager for Python, it allows you to install and manage additional packages that are not part of the Python standard library.

If you don't have pip installed, we can install it as follows ([original source](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)):

**Copied from the source** above:**

!!! Failure ""
    === ":simple-windows:"

        ```powershell
         py -m ensurepip --upgrade
        ```

    === ":simple-apple:"

        ```bash
        python -m ensurepip --upgrade
        ```
    
    === ":simple-linux:"

        ```bash
        python -m ensurepip --upgrade
        ```



### Checking Your Pip Version

If you're not sure which version of pip you have installed, you can check by running one of the following in your terminal:

!!! Failure ""
    === ":simple-windows:"

        ```powershell
        py -m pip --version
        ```

    === ":simple-apple:"

        ```bash
        python3 -m pip --version
        ```

    === ":simple-linux:"

        ```bash
        python3 -m pip --version
        ```

This should return something like this:


!!! warning ""

    ```
    pip 23.0 from /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip (python 3.10)
    ```


## (Optional) Python Environment

If you are new to Python, you may want to consider using a Python environment. A Python environment is a tool that helps you manage different versions of Python and Python packages. Using a virtual environment is always a good idea, and is suggested for this tutorial.

There are many different Python environments available, some of the most popular ones include:

* [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
* [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

Other more advanced alternatives are:

* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
* [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/)

Alternatively, any Anaconda variant is also a good choice:

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
* [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
* [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)


If this topic is confusing or overwhelming, stick to the easiest option, which is **virtualenv**. 
Alternatively, if you have Anaconda already installed, you can use that.

### Virtualenv

**Virtualenv** is a tool to create isolated Python environments. Virtualenv creates a folder that contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.

Virtualenv can be installed and used in this manner: ([source](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)):
