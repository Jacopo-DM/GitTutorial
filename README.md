Welcome to the official website of the "Introduction to Git" VU workshop organized by MSc Mentor Program (2023)!
:wink:

This tutorial contains a series of lessons that will teach you the basics of Git. It is intended for beginners who have never used Git before, but it can also serve as a refresher course for those who have used it in the past.

Hopefully, you landed on this page after opening the link given to you on the day of the event, or as one of the pre-session reviewers, if you stumbled upon this page by accident please bare in mind this website was designed to go hand-in-hand with a physical workshop and isn't meant to be used as a standalone resource.
